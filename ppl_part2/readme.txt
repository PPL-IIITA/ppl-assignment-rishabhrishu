 * Documentation can be found inside respective project folder/dist/javadoc/index.html. It can be regenerated by using corresponding build_run.sh file.
 * Documentation of library can be found in library_documentation/index.html . It can be regenerated by using corresponding build_run.sh file.
 * Log files can be found inside respective project folder/logfile.txt
   Note:- Notepad has some issues with displaying it correctly, use wordpad instead, in case of Windows Machine

 * To build the project, Apache Ant is required.
   For ubuntu, ant can be downloaded by-

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install ant

  * First of all, we need to run build_runTestCase.sh to generate test case.
    Then, everytime we tweak into RelationshipFinder package, we need to rebuild it. This can be accomplished by running buildLibrary.sh
    Then, to run individual questions, use corresponding script to re-build the project, and then run it.
    To use script on linux environments , do the following :-

    linux:~$ ppl-master/ppl_part2$ bash -f scriptname.sh


	If we dont want to use the sh file, or while using environments other than linux,
	we can build the project by :-
	1. Going in home folder of corresponding question.
	2. On command line, type 'ant' without quotes.This will compile, generate executable, and generate javadoc
	3. Going to dist directory , and running the jar, thus formed, by typing 'java -jar <jarname.jar>', without <> and ''.
	For eg., to recompile and run ques3 , we will type following on command prompt(shown by linux:~$ ) ->
		linux:~$ ppl-assign-master/ppl_part2$ cd ques3/
		linux:~$ ppl-assign-master/ppl_part2/ques3$ ant
		linux:~$ ppl-assign-master/ppl_part2/ques3$ cd dist/
		linux:~$ ppl-assign-master/ppl_part2/ques3/dist$ java -jar ques3.jar
			//program will execute
		linux:~$ ppl-assign-master/ppl_part2ques3/dist$ cd ../.. 
		linux:~$ ppl-assign-master/ppl_part2$ 
	4. Documentation is automatically generated by ant


 * NOTE :- DO NOT DELETE FOLDERS, as relative addressing is used in file I/O Opertions and import statements.
   Delete files inside folder, but please leave directory structure intact for proper functioning of codes.
 
 ** Build tested on 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with:-
	# java version "1.8.0_101" 
	# Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.3



   ps:- if using any IDE, all the projects can be run on netbeans.
